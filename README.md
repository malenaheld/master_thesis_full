# master_thesis_full

This is the repository, where all the code and the data used for my master thesis is stored.

The data for the simulations for the three main cases can be found on the aleph server at:
- aleph/data/mheld/salmo/SALMO_simulations/trueVD_1024 (the fiducial systematics case with 1 observational systematic)
- aleph/data/mheld/salmo/SALMO_simulations/multiVD_1024_10clust (the case with multiple systematics and 10 clusters)
- aleph/data/mheld/salmo/SALMO_simulations/multiVD_1024_20clust (the case with multiple systematics and 20 clusters)
